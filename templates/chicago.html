    Chicago
  </h1>
  <hr>

  <p>
    For those coming in from out of town, here are some suggestions on what to
    do in Chicago while you're here! Note that our wedding is taking place two
    days before the Chicago marathon, so plan accordingly if you plan to stay the
    weekend.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our venue is located in the Pilsen neighborhood, near downtown on the
    southwest side.
  </p>

  <br>
  <h1 class="display-5">Transportation</h1>

  <p>
    Parking is available at the venue, but there are also a number of public transit
    options near the hotel and the venue.
  </p>
  <p>
    The hotel is a very short walk from the Cermak-McCormick Place green line
    station, and a short (but slightly longer) walk from the Cermak-Chinatown
    red line station.
  </p>
  <p>
    The venue is about halfway between the Cermak-Chinatown red line station and the
    18th Street pink line station. It's about a mile either direction, which is walkable,
    or you can take the #21 Cermak bus.

  <br>
	<h3>Chinatown</h3>
	<p>
    The Chinatown neighborhood is about a mile east of the venue, and a short
    walk from the hotel if you're staying there. If you like Chinese food, you
    really can't go wrong here.
